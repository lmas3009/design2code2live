                     <br><br>
                     <h1 class="sub_head">5. Wash your hands often</h1>
                     Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.<br><br>

                     If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and   rub them together until they feel dry.<br><br>
                     Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                     <br><br><br>
                     <h1 class="sub_head">6. Cover coughs and sneezes</h1>
                     If you are wearing a mask:
                     <ul>
                     <li>You can cough or sneeze into your mask.</li>
                     <li>Put on a new, clean mask as soon as possible and wash your hands.</li></ul><br>
                     If you are not wearing a mask:
                     <ul>
                       <li>Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.</li>
                       <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li></ul><br>
                     Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with   a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
                     <br><br><br>
                     <h1 class="sub_head">7. Clean and disinfect</h1>
                     Clean high touch surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.<br><br>
                     If someone is sick or has tested positive for COVID-19, disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Use a household disinfectant product from EPA’s List N:

                    If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
