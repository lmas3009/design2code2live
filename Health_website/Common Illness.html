            <h1 class="sum_head">ALLERGIES</h1>
            Allergies are an immune response triggered by allergens, an ordinarily harmful substance.<br><br>
            
            <h2 class="head_under">SYMPTOMS</h2> 
            Because there are so many possible causes, the symptoms of allergies vary widely. Airborne allergens, like pollen and pet dander, are likely to cause:
            <ul>
                <li>Eye irritation</li>
                <li>Runny nose</li>
                <li>Stuffy nose</li>
                <li>Puffy, watery eyes</li>
                <li>Sneezing</li>
                <li>Inflamed, itchy nose and throat</li></ul><br>
            
            Allergens that are consumed, like foods or certain medications, can cause:
            <ul>
            <li>Hives or skin rashes</li>
            <li>Gastrointestinal distress (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, excessing gas, indigestion)</li>
                <li>Tingling or swelling of the lips, face, or tongue</li>
                    <li>Itchiness</li>
                        <li>Difficulty breathing or wheezing</li>
                            <li>Fainting/ or lightheadedness</li>
                                <li>In cases of a more extreme response, called anaphylaxis, symptoms are severe and life-threatening.</li></ul><br><br>
            
            <h2 class="head_under">TREATEMENT</h2> 
            The easiest and most effective way to treat allergies is to get rid of or avoid the cause. Where unavoidable, some lifestyle changes can reduce your allergy symptoms. For example, if you are allergic to dust mites, make an effort to keep your room clean and free of dust by frequent vacuuming, dusting, and washing of bedding.
            
            For pollen allergies, avoid being outside when pollen counts are high and keep the windows to your room shut.
            
            Because it is very difficult to avoid certain allergens, medication may be necessary to lessen symptoms caused by allergens, other than food and drugs.

             <h1 class="sum_head">COLD AND FLU</h1> 
            Colds and influenza (flu) are the most common illnesses among college students. <br><br>
            
            <h2 class="head_under">SYMPTOMS</h2>
            Flu symptoms come on suddenly and affect the body all over. Flu symptoms are usually more serious than a cold and include:
            <ul>
            <li>fever (100° F),</li>
            <li>headache,</li>
            <li>more intense pain and fatigue, and more severe, often dry cough.</li>
            <li>When you get the flu, you are also more prone to bronchitis, sinus, and ear infections.</li>
        </ul><br>
            Cold symptoms mostly affect above the neck and include:
            <ul>
            <li>a runny or stuffy nose (nasal congestion),</li>
            <li>sneezing,</li>
                <li>sore throat, and</li>
                    <li>cough.</li>
                        <li>You may also experience a mild headache, body aches or a low grade fever. Typically, a cold lasts 2-14 days.</li>
        </ul><br><br>
            <h2 class="head_under">TREATMENT</h2>
            If any problem is causing you discomfort, you should seek medical care. Seek medical attention promptly if you have:
            <ul>
                <li>a fever of 102° F or greater (which may indicate a more serious infection),</li>
                    <li>a persisting cough, especially with a significant fever (which could indicate pneumonia),</li>
                        <li>a persistent sore throat (especially if runny nose does not develop - which could indicate a strep infection), or</li>
                            <li>any cold lasting more than 10 days.</li></ul><br>
            
            Because colds and flu are caused by viruses, they cannot be cured by antibiotics. There are tips to help you feel better and strengthen your immune system to fight illness:
            <ul>
            <li>Rest more than usual and avoid exercise until symptoms are gone.</li>
            <li>Drink lots of clear fluids (e.g., water, tea).</li>
            <li>Stay away from cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li>Do not take antibiotics unless specifically prescribed for you to cure the illness from which you currently suffer.</li>
            <li>Avoid drinking alcohol because it weakens your immune system and may interact with medications.</li>
            <li>Avoid caffeine, which can increase congestion and dehydration.</li>
            <li>Eat a well-balanced diet, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.</li></ul>

            <h1 class="sum_head">MONONUCLEOSIS</h1>
            
            Mononucleosis is an illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is spread through saliva.<br><br>
            
            <h2 class="head_under">SYMPTOMS</h2> 
            The most well known symptom of “mono“ is extreme fatigue, forcing the infected person to nap frequently. If you experience such extreme fatigue accompanied by other symptoms, such as swollen lymph glands and spleen, sore throat, fever, loss of appetite, and muscle aches, you may want to get tested for mono. The basis for testing whether you have mono is the presence of antibodies produced by white blood cells. Many people infected with mono don’t get sick, or have such mild symptoms they don’t know they have it. EBV is usually in the body 30-50 days before an infected person develops symptoms. Surprisingly, 80-95% of adults in the US have been infected by the time they’re 40, but only about 20% know they’ve had mono.
            <br><br>
            
            <h2 class="head_under">TREATEMENT</h2>
            Mono is a virus, so antibiotics won’t help. Make sure you get plenty of rest, eat healthy foods, avoid alcohol (because your liver may be inflamed and drinking weakens immune responses), drink plenty of fluids, take aspirin or an aspirin substitute to reduce pain and fever, gargle salt water to relieve sore throat, and avoid strenuous activity. Because your spleen may be swollen, it is important not to engage in contact sports which could rupture your spleen. Returning to normal activity too quickly increases your chances of relapse.
